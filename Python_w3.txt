Variables:
> Doesnt have to be declared.
> Casting: Process of converting one data to another data type
> Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
> Type: used to get the data type
> Rule to declare variable: Alphanumeric containing underscore.
> Multi words variable: camelcase, pascal case and snake case.
> We can assign values to multiple variables in single line.
> If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking
> Variables that are created outside of a function are known as Global variable. If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.
> Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function. To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.
> Shared reference: The situation where multiple names refer the same object.
  Ex: x = 5;
      y = x;
	  y will store 5

Date types:
> Text : string.
> Numeric: int, float, complex
> Sequence: list, tuples, range
> Mapping: dict
> Set types: set, frozeset
> Boolean: bool
> Binary: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
> None type: Nonetype

Numeric:
>int: Is a whole number, positive or negative without decimals.
> float: Is a number, positve or negative containing one or more decimals.
> complex: Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part.
> Type conversion: You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods.
Note: cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.
> Random number:Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers
