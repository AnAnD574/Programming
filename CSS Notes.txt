CSS:
>  CSS is a standard style sheet language used for describing the presentation (i.e. the layout and formatting) of the web pages.
> Inline styles — Using the style attribute in the HTML start tag.
> Embedded styles — Using the <style> element in the head section of a document.
> External style sheets — Using the <link> element, pointing to an external CSS file. (Need to create a new file with css extension) / The @import rule is another way of loading an external style sheet. The @import statement instructs the browser to load an external style sheet and use its styles. (But Import is not recommended).
